# Changelog

Player-facing notes for each release. Write for players: what they can now
do or see, and what was broken and now works. Leave out internal changes.
Sections are `### New` and `### Fixed`; skip one that would be empty.

## 1.2.0

### New
- DoT marker: each school of damage over time is now a liquid of its own,
  so a warlock's Corruption and Immolate show as Void and Fire side by side.
  The school you put up first sits at the front of the health, the next
  behind it. Two schools show at once; a third joins the second.

## 1.1.0

### New
- DoT marker: the health your damage-over-time spells will still burn away
  turns into a second liquid on your target's health bar, in your DoTs'
  colour (Void for Shadow, Fire, Plague for Nature, Blood for bleeds...),
  eating into the health liquid. If no health liquid is left, your DoTs will
  kill the target, and the game's skull shows on its portrait. It goes by
  your spells' tooltips and runs each DoT for its whole duration. Off
  unless you turn it on: the setup has a new last step for it, and it is
  under Damage Over Time in the settings. `/sab dots` shows what it is
  tracking.
- A new icon in the AddOns list: the Greater Nether Essence.

## 1.0.0

### New
- Liquid health and power bars on the player and target frames, with the
  liquid from Smooth Experience Bar: waves, a magic swirl, bubbles,
  sparkles and lightning. It eases to wherever the game's bar is and
  stirs whenever the bar changes.
- Health and power each take the game's colour (green health; blue mana,
  red rage, yellow energy) or any of 24 themes, Class Color and Faction
  among them, with their own particles.
- Turn each bar and each effect on or off in Options > AddOns > Smooth
  Animated Bars, or with `/sab`. `/sab on` and `/sab off` switch all four
  bars at once.
- A short setup on your first login: which bars, their colours and how
  lively they are, each shown as you pick it on preview player and target
  frames (and your own frame). Skip puts everything back. Open it again
  with `/sab setup` or from the settings.
